No-CSRF
=======
A chrome plugin meant to serve as a client-side protection against CSRF attacks.
It strips cookies from non-GET cross-origin requests unless the request is
specifically user-initiated. 

This repository is forked from [avlidienbrunn's](https://github.com/avlidienbrunn/anti-csrf-plugin) plugin
and is based off of _Cross-Site Request Forgeries: Exploitation and Prevention_
written by Zeller et al (2008 rev).
